# 🏨 Jhattse Business: The 2026 Hotelier’s Success FAQ

Welcome to the ultimate guide for **Jhattse Business**. Whether you are a **new property owner** launching your first homestay or a **veteran hotelier** looking to migrate from legacy systems, this FAQ covers everything you need to know about increasing visibility, revenue, and efficiency in 2026.

## 🏗️ Section 1: For the New Hotel Owner (Getting Started)

**Q1: I’m new to the hotel industry. Why do I need a PMS from day one?** A Property Management System (PMS) like Jhattse is your "digital front desk." It prevents manual errors, tracks every rupee, and ensures your guests receive professional digital invoices via WhatsApp instantly. Without it, you lose hours to paperwork.

**Q2: Is Jhattse Business easy for my staff to learn?** Yes. In 2026, staff turnover is a challenge. Jhattse is designed with an intuitive interface that reduces training time by up to 80%. If they can use a smartphone, they can manage your hotel.

**Q3: Does the software work for small homestays or just big hotels?** It is built for both. Our pricing starts at just **₹16,000 + GST**, making it the most affordable premium solution for small boutique stays while being powerful enough for 50+ room hotels.

## 📈 Section 2: Increasing Visibility & Revenue

**Q4: How does the Channel Manager (CM) increase my hotel's visibility?** In 2026, 26% of travelers start their research on OTAs. The CM pushes your inventory to Booking.com, Agoda, and MMT simultaneously. High visibility without the risk of overbooking leads to higher occupancy.

**Q5: How can I stop paying high commissions to OTAs?** Use our **Direct Booking Engine**. By putting a "Book Now" link on your Instagram and Website, guests book directly with you. You keep 100% of the revenue, and the booking flows straight into your PMS.

**Q6: What is "Dynamic Pricing" and how does it help me in 2026?** Travel demand changes by the hour. Jhattse allows you to set rules: "If occupancy is > 80%, increase price by 20%." This ensures you never leave money on the table during local festivals or peak weekends.

## 🔄 Section 3: For the Veteran Hotelier (Upgrading)

**Q7: I’ve used the same software for 10 years. Why should I switch now?** Legacy systems are often "offline" and don't sync with WhatsApp or modern OTAs. Jhattse is cloud-based, meaning you can check your hotel's collection and occupancy from your phone while you are traveling.

**Q8: Can I migrate my old guest data to Jhattse?** Yes. Our team assists with data migration so you don't lose your history of loyal guests.

**Q9: How does the "All-in-One" approach beat using separate tools?** When your PMS, Channel Manager, and POS are separate, data gets lost. With Jhattse, a food order from the **Restaurant POS** is automatically added to the room bill in the **PMS**, which then updates your total revenue in the **Reports**.

---

## 🧹 Section 4: Operational Efficiency & Housekeeping

**Q10: How does the system automate housekeeping?** The moment a guest checks out, the PMS triggers a "Dirty" status for that room. Housekeeping staff get a notification on their mobile, and once cleaned, they mark it "Ready," making it instantly available for the next check-in.

**Q11: Can I track my laundry and other extra services?** Yes. You can add "Add-on Tasks" like laundry, extra bedding, or airport transfers, ensuring every service is billed and no revenue is leaked.

---

## 💬 Section 5: The "WhatsApp Factor" (Guest Experience)

**Q12: Why is WhatsApp integration important for my clients?** Guests in 2026 hate downloading apps. They want their booking confirmation, WiFi password, and digital bill on WhatsApp. Jhattse automates this, leading to better reviews and higher guest satisfaction.

**Q13: Can I send promotional offers to old guests?** Yes. Use the guest database to send "Return Guest Discounts" via WhatsApp or Email, driving repeat business without spending on ads.

---

## 💰 Section 6: Pricing & ROI

**Q14: What is the ROI of a ₹16,000 investment?** Most owners see ROI within the first month by:

1. Reducing "No-shows" through automated WhatsApp reminders.
2. Selling just 2-3 extra rooms via the Channel Manager.
3. Stopping revenue leakage in the restaurant/POS.

**Q15: Are there any hidden charges?** No. Our pricing is transparent. ₹16,000 + 18% GST covers the core suite to get your business running at professional standards.
